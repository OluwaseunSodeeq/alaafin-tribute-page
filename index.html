            <p class="first-parag">Alaafin, or The Owner of the Palace in the Yoruba language, is the title of the emperor of the medieval Oyo empire and present-day Oyo town of West Africa. He ruled the old Oyo Empire which extended from the present day Benin republic to Nigeria originating from states in the South East and West to the North. The people under him are called Yoruba people and spoke the Yoruba Language.</p>
            <p>The Alaafin of Oyo in Yoruba mythology and history is said to be one of Oduduwa seven grandsons who later became Kings, forming the bedrock of the Yoruba Civilization .</p>
            <p>The title was retained after the fall of the Oyo Empire as the official title of the ceremonial ruler of the contemporary natives of Oyo, Nigeria. The Alaafin is the political head of the Yoruba people and the only monarch with the pre-requisite power to appoint a chieftain representing the entire Yorubaland. Examples of such appointments include Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland and Iyalode of Yorubaland.</p>
            <p>As of 2021 the Alaafin (Emperor) of Oyo was Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III who was the 45th Alaafin, celebrated his 50th year on the throne. Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III, Iku Baba Yeye, Alaafin (Emperor) of Oyo was the permanent Chairman, Oyo State Council of Obas and Chiefs until his death on Friday, 22 April 2022.</p>

        <h3   class="list">List of All The Alaafins  of Oyo </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span> Alaafin Oranyan,</span> he was the grandson or some say son, of Oduduwa, founder of the second Ife dynasty and ancestor to most kings of Yorubaland.</li>
            <li><span> Alaafin Ajaka, </span> he Succeeded his father, Oranyan. He was said to be a peaceful and calm king, unlike his father, and brother, and his peacefulness caused his more angry and powerful brother to take over and overthrow him.</li>
            <li><span> Alaafin Shango,</span> he was another son of Oranyan, he was appointed by the Oyo Mesi after dethroning his brother, Ajaka, he reigned for 7 years, after which he became regarded as an orisha having been combined with Jakuta, an earlier orisha in Yoruba mythology</li>
            <li><span> Alaafin Ajaka,</span> he  was later called on to ascend the throne after the death of Sango. In his later years, he changed from being mild mannered to a warlike emperor, and was similar to his brother. The Basorun or prime minister and commander-in-chief during his second reign was Salekoudi, and it was in this period that the Yoruban drum, Ogidigbo, was introduced to Oyo. The drum was and still is used in great festivals where the Alaafin and the Basorun are present.</li>
            <li><span> Alaafin Aganjusola,</span>Son of Ajaka who succeeded his father. He was said to have tamed many wild animals, and he reigned for an incredibly long time. He is synonymous with the Yoruba deity of the same name</li>
            <li><span> Alaafin Kori,</span>Succeeded his father, Aganju, who died while he was still a child. The early period of his reign was overseen by his mother, Iyayun as regent. He waged a war with town of Ede. Under Alaafin Kori, the city of Oyo Ile expanded to include the region referred to as metropolitan Oyo. He is also regarded to have reigned over 50 years making him the longest reigning Alaafin,before Lamidi Adeyemi 111 comes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rulers_of_the_Yoruba_state_of_Oyo" id="tribute-link"  target="_blank">Read More..</a></li>

            <h3>AlAAFIN OROMPOTONIYUN : THE FIRST FEMALE ALAAFIN OF OYO</h3>
           
            <div class="third-inner">

                <p class="first-parag">It is so easy to come across male traditional rulers in Nigeria and Africa at large. They’re very visible figures seen around their local communities and are even known wider, depending on the particular ruler. However, it is almost unusual to hear of female rulers in Nigeria. Often times, they are either wives and put in charge of the ‘domestic affairs’ as heads of women groups. This is a reflection of the patriarchal nature of affairs in the country and laws that women cannot hold such positions in their local communities.</p>
                <img src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Alafin-of-Oyo.-Photo-Good-Books-Africa.jpg" alt="The first Female Alafin-of-Oyo">
                <p>One of the most common outliers, when the topic of female leadership in the traditional society is mentioned, is Orompoto. Orompoto or Orompotoniyun as she’s more commonly referred to as made history as the first and only female Alaafin of Oyo. The Oyo Empire is one of the foremost empires in West Africa and rose through the outstanding organisational and administrative skills of the Yoruba people. Orompoto was responsible for leading the Oyo Empire between the years 1554 to 1562. She was the daughter of Alaafin Ofinran and the grand-daughter of Alaafin Onigbogi, both rulers of the Empire in their own time.</p>
                <p>When her father died, her brother, Prince Eguguoju became the next in line to the throne and he succeeded his father. However, he died in his young without a male successor. Her younger brothers, Prince Ajiboyede and Prince Tella were very young and as such couldn’t assume the throne at the time. As a result, Orompoto would leave her role as a regent (one that was instrumental in driving the Nupe from Oyo in 1555 after a protracted battle) to assume the throne. This decision didn’t sit well with the council of chiefs as there had been no female rulers in the history of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The chiefs and elders had started making plans on who to install as the next ruler of the Oyo Empire. For every plan they made, Orompoto was even more strong-willed and insistent that she was the only link to the dynasty and had to sit on the throne. In a bid to defend her family rights, Princess Orompoto summoned the chiefs to discuss plans for her coronation and this met the same negligent response. She then asked to prove to the elders and chiefs that she was a man, seeing as that was the only hindrance to her coronation. The chiefs thought it would be a good way to ridicule her and asked her to prove her masculinity and strip naked at the palace in seven days. <a href="https://guardian.ng/life/orompoto-the-first-female-alaafin-of-oyo/" id="tribute-link-refrence-4"  target="_blank">Read More..</a></p>

            <p class="first-parag">The Son of Death that was eventually killed by Death</p>
            <p>Alaafin Adeyemi III was born Lamidi Olayiwola Atanda Adeyemi on 15 October 1938 into the Alowolodu Royal House, and as a member of the House of Oranmiyan to Raji Adeniran Adeyemi (born 1871–1960), who later became Alaafin in 1945, and Ibironke of Epo-Gingin, who died when he was young. His father is said to have had over 200 wives. His paternal grandfather was Alaafin Adeyemi I Alowolodu, who ruled during the Kiriji War, and was the last independent ruler of the Oyo Empire before British colonialism. Alaafin Adeyemi I's father, and Adeyemi III's great-grandfather was Oba Atiba Atobatele, who founded New Oyo. Atiba's father, his great-great-grandfather, was Alaafin Abiodun, and is a direct descendant of Oranmiyan, the founder of the Oyo Empire.</p>

            <p>Lamidi's father, the Alaafin of Oyo Oba Adeyemi II Adeniran, was deposed and exiled in 1954 for sympathizing with the National Council of Nigerian Citizens (NCNC). He had come into conflict with Bode Thomas, deputy leader of the Action Group.</p>
            <p>According to rumors, Bode Thomas shouted at him for not standing to greet him as the chairman of NCNC during a political gathering at a party. Oba Adeyemi II Adeniran, insulted, stood and then told Bode Thomas to go home and bark like a dog. Later, he started coughing blood and died while walking back home leaving his entourage. Shortly, Herbert Macaulay heard of the catastrophe, and along with Obafemi Awolowo accused Oba Adeyemi II of poisoning Thomas, and then exiled him from his kingdom. He lived out the rest of his days in Lagos where his subjects still visited him until his death in 1960. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamidi_Adeyemi_III" id="tribute-link-refrence-5"  target="_blank">Read More..</a></p>
